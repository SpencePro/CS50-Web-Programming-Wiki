# CS50 Web Programming - Encyclopedia

### Description

This is a simple encyclopedia app created using Django. It was made as an assignment for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming with 
Python and JavaScript online course. It is a wikipedia-like encyclopedia that displays information about various topics via 
Markdown files. There is a single HTML page that displays all information, and the text inside is simply loaded from a saved 
Markdown file. 

### Functionality

Users can view all the available pages, as well as click a link to take them to a random page. Users can search for pages, and the 
search function performs a regex search to find any matches on the website, complete or incomplete, and display the results to the 
user. Users are also able to create new entries, which will be saved as their own Markdown files. Finally, users can edit entries.
